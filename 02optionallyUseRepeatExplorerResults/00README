To select k-mers corresponding to ReepatExplorer super clusters, you need access the a RepeatExplorer output folder.
This directory contains the scripts we used. They have to be adjusted for your individual dataset.

WORKFLOW:
1. 01ReData.R is an R script that can be adjusted to extract all sequencing reads from each super cluster (default is top 50). It produces text files in fasta format.
2. In a bash-like shell, concatenate these files inserting FASTA headers in between: "touch allSuReadsConcat.fa; for i in su??; do echo ">$i" >> allSuReadsConcat.fa; grep -v ">" $i >> allSuReadsConcat.fa; done"
3. Then run UniquKMER (https://github.com/OpenGene/UniqueKMER/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.0.tar.gz) on the concatenated file.
4. Then descend into UniqueKMER's output folder and generate KMC data bases from each unique k-mer FASTA file: for i in {01..50}; do kmc -k21 -ci1 su$i.kmer.fasta su$i.db21 .; done
5. Use these KMC DBs to extract from each sample the k-mer corresponding to the super clusters (02extractFromSamples.sh). This results in ca. 50 files per sample.
6. Dump the k-mers of the reference sample using 03dumpE030.sh.
7. Run pairwise comparisons for each sample and the refeence sample and generate binned joint k-mer dumps for each sample and each super cluster (04allJoins.sh)


NOTE
This directory contains a gzipped concatenated read file, which can be used to recreate our results starting from step 3 above.
